TODO: This

Right now the eSports portion of the wrapper (Jinx) does not work. However, the DataDragon portion (Jhin) and the Fantasy portion (Zoe). As for the lolesports live stream websocket portion (Willump), I have to wait until the NA LCS resumes to work on it. 

To use you need Unity. Any recent version will work... probably. Best bet is to use 2018.3.0b9 because that is what I developed it on. If you use the .unitypackage though, it should work with any recent version... I think.
