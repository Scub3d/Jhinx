Right now only the DataDragon portion works (Jhin) and the Fantasy portion (Zoe). To use you need Unity. Any recent version will work... probably. Best bet is to use 2018.3.0b9 because that is what I developed it on. If you use the .unitypackage though, it should work with any recent version... I think.
